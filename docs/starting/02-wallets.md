# Wallets
These are all the wallets that allow you to store Neurai (XNA) securely and with different Operating Systems or devices.

:::warning

Remember that it is very important to make a backup of the wallet once it has been created. 

For added security, it is advisable to destroy the wallet and restore it with the saved data to ensure a good copy.
